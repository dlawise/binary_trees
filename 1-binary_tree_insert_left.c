 * binary_tree_insert_left - inserts a node as a left-child of another node
 *
 * @parent: pointer to the node to insert the left-child in

 * Return: pointer to the new node or NULL if parent is NULL or an error occurs

 *              takes its place and the old left-child is set as
 *              the left-child of the new node
